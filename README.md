## Abstract

This project investigates Micro Relative Value (Micro RV) opportunities by analyzing localized dislocations in dealer-constructed interest rate curves. Using historical swap data across multiple currencies, we construct daily yield curves via natural cubic spline interpolation and identify curvature-based anomalies through butterfly spreads. We evaluate each structure using rolling-window $z$-scores and carry metrics, and select the most statistically significant configurations for backtesting. The profitability of these trades is assessed through DV01-adjusted PnL simulations under dynamically evolving maturities. Our numerical analysis suggests that Micro RV signals have the potential to generate profitable trades, with meaningful dislocations observed across different maturities and currencies under certain conditions.
